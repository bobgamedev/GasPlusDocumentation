GAS Plus is an extension of the popular Gameplay Ability System created by Epic Games.
It was developed with the intention to make professional Multiplayer experiences available even to smalller/newer developers.
While it primarily aims at creating competitive multiplayer games such as FPS games (e.g. Counter Strike, Call of Duty), MOBA games (e.g. League of Legends, Dota 2) or RPGs (Dark Souls, The Witcher, Genshin Impact),
it can be used in any type of game, as well as singleplayer games.
